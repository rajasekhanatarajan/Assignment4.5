#Compute the measures of central tendency for salary and reduction which variable has highest center?

A measure of central tendency (also referred to as measures of centre or central location) is a summary measure that attempts to describe a whole set of data with a single value that represents the middle or centre of its distribution. There are three main measures of central tendency: the mode, the median and the mean. Each of these measures describes a different indication of the typical or central value in the distribution.

#Which measure of center is more appropriate for before and after?

The mean is commonly used, but sometimes the median is preferred.
